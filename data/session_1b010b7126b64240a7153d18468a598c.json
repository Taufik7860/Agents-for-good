You press the **power button**.\n3. But the power button does different things for different devices:\n   - For the TV, it turns the TV on or off.\n   - For the fan, it turns the fan on or off.\n   - For the radio, it turns the radio on or off.\n\nEven though you press the **same button**, the result changes depending on the device.\n\n### So, in programming:\n- One action (like pressing the button) can do different things.\n- It depends on the object you are using (TV, fan, radio).\n- This is **polymorphism** — one thing, many actions.\n\n### Why is it useful?\n- It helps programmers write simple code.\n- The same command can work with many objects.\n\nIf you want, I can help you learn more with easy examples or practice questions!"

The toy does something different depending on what toy it is:\n   - If it’s a **car**, it moves.\n   - If it’s a **doll**, it talks.\n   - If it’s a **robot**, it dances.\n\n- You press **the same button**.\n- But the toy does **different things**.\n\nIn programming:\n\n- One command can work with many different things.\n- The thing you use decides what happens.\n\nThis is called **polymorphism** — one command, many results.\n\nIf you want, I can help you with easy examples or questions!"

You **play** with the toy.\n\nBut:\n\n- If the toy is a **car**, you push it to make it move.\n- If the toy is a **doll**, you dress it up.\n- If the toy is a **ball**, you throw or catch it.\n\n### So:\n\n- You do the same thing: **play**.\n- But playing is different for each toy.\n\n### In programming:\n\n- You use the same command.\n- But the computer does different things depending on the object.\n\nThis is **polymorphism** — one command, many actions!\n\nWant me to help you with more easy examples?"
